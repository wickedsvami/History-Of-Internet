            <p> The dotcom bubble, also known as the internet bubble, was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s. It had been building up for the better part of three years, slowly began to pop. Stocks sunk. Companies folded. Fortunes were lost, and the American economy started to slip down a slow mudslide that would end up in full-on recession.</p>

            <p>The buildup of the bubble occurred in the 1990’s, as access to the internet expanded and computing took on an increasingly important part in people’s daily lives. Online retailing was one of the biggest drivers of this growth, with sites such as Pets, Etoys and Priceline. With the investment in the exciting future of the internet stocks grew rapidly. The value of the NASDAQ, home to many of the biggest tech stocks, grew from around 1,000 points in 1995 to more than 5,000 in 2000.</p>

            <p>When the bubble finally burst in the March of 2000 things started to take a turn for the worst. Initially, the combined values of stocks on the NASDAQ was at $6.71 trillion but by March 30, the NASDAQ was valued at $6.02 trillion. Then on April 6, 2000, it was $5.78 trillion. This was when companies such as Pets started to fall apart and magazines started advising investors to limit exposure to online retailers. Else their respective portfolios would lose value quickly.</p>

            <p>Many have made the case that the dot-com era was doomed to failure simply because there were too many companies chasing what at the time were too few users. When the bubble burst in 2000, there were only around 400 million people online worldwide.  However in 2010, there were an estimated 200 million. In the long run the habits we acquired during the bubble era ingrained themselves into the rhythms of everyday life. The dot-coms from that time, the training wheels for the internet, taught us to live online.</p>
