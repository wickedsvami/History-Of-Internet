                <p> As you might expect for a technology so expansive and ever-changing,
                    it is impossible to credit the invention of the internet to a single person.
                    The internet was the work of dozens of pioneering scientists, programmers and
                    engineers who each developed new features and technologies that eventually merged
                    to become the “information superhighway” we know today.</p>

                <p>The Internet history starts in the 1960s. In 1962, MIT computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider
                    comes up with the idea for a global computer network. He shares his idea with colleagues
                    at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This leads to
                    an ARPA-funded computer network that becomes a reality in 1969. Over the following years,
                    the ARPANET grows.</p>

                <p>Then 1982, the PhoneNet system is established and is connected to ARPANET and the first
                    commercial network, Telenet. This was created by the University of Delaware using Dial
                    Up connections. This made it easier to access the internet and allow email communication
                    between multiple nations of the world. In 1981, Metcalfe’s company 3Com announces Ethernet
                    products for both computer workstations and personal computers; this allows for the
                    establishment of local area networks (LANs).</p>

                <p>Then in 1990s, ARPANET was shut down and it was during this period that HTML was developed
                    as well as the universal resource locator (URL). In the 2000s we see the rise and burst of
                    the dotcom bubble. While myriad internet-based businesses become present in everyday life,
                    the Dow Jones industrial average also sees its biggest one-day drop in history up to that
                    point. </p>
