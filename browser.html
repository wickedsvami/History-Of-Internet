            <p> The Browser Wars something that kicked off in the 1990’s just around the period when the internet became somewhat of a widely used phenomenon. The people who did decide to visit the web for the first time found themselves in the middle of a technological arms race between two internet browsers. It was a conflict that was public, publicized and wide reaching. Its repercussions would ripple out to web designers, web users and the software community at large for years to come.</p>

            <p>If it were 1995 the only browser of choice was the Netscape Navigator. It was developed by software engineer Marc Andreessen. However, Microsoft failed to recognize the importance of this new network early on, so the company fell back on their core competency: personal computing. That means, if you used the Windows operating system, you would have to go purchase a browser separately. As a result, their internet project was supported by executives from the top of their company, then a few Microsoft engineers got together to start working on a new browser. </p>

            <p>Microsoft eventually released Internet Explorer.  Then for the next few years, Netscape and Microsoft waged “war”. Essentially you would see minor updates very frequently. Although, most end users did not understand the war. All they saw where a whirlwind of new features. There came esoteric plugin support, proprietary presentational HTML elements and all sorts of unique hacks. Even when one browser or the other supported web standards, they did so only at a surface level. So when features were “supported” by both browsers, they would often be interpreted and rendered in completely different ways.</p>

            <p>Then Microsoft pulled a big move and with the release of Internet Explorer 3.0, Microsoft dropped the hammer. They included this version, for free, bundled right into the Windows ’95 operating system. No longer would users have to go to their local electronics shop and chose from a few competitive options. In the summer of 1998, Microsoft went on trial for violating antitrust laws and a consent decree from a few years ago. The US Department of Justice argued that by giving away their browser for free, and bundling it into their operating system, they forced consumers to use their product and pushed competitors out of the market.</p>

            <p>Eventually the presiding Judge issued his findings of fact, which, among other things, found that Microsoft was abusing a monopoly position, and wanted them to split into two companies. Even though they lost the court case, Internet Explorer still ended up with the largest market share.</p>
