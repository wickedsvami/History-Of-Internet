                Originally, when people liked or discovered a song, band, album etc., they would have to go out
                and look for a record store to bring a CD back home to listen to.  Eventually, people started
                bringing music to the web, which made the accessibility to music widely available. Soon enough
                mp3 files would be introduced, which would compact music files into a much smaller digital
                packet which made it much easier to travel around the web.   Along with mp3 files, downloadable
                media players were created so that people could easily access any music they may have downloaded
                and play it freely.

                In 1999, 2 college students named Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker would essentially create the
                first independent peer-to-peer file sharing service that specialized in mp3 files, known as
                Napster.  Within a short amount of time, Napster had blown up at an exponential rate, and soon
                had the music industry, namely the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), breathing
                down their neck.  Due to copyright claims, what Napster was doing was highly illegal and was
                stealing much of the profits that would be going to artists and record labels etc., and could
                have potentially been the end of the record industry, among many other industries.  It was a
                music revolution, and the ripples are still felt to this day.

                Napster would eventually be shut down by court order, but it canâ€™t  be denied that it paved the
                way for many brands that are widely known and used today.  Napster allowed users to interact and
                share content with one another, and this idea would spark many more companies in the future.  In
                2003, MySpace would come around originally as a place to share mp3 files, but would further grow
                into a massive social networking space.  Although Napster and MySpace would be short lived
                ventures, the ideas that they sparked and paths that they paved would change the Internet
                forever.  The companies that would later walk those paths paved by them would grow to become
                massive giants in the tech and media worlds respectively, such as Facebook, Youtube, Spotify,
                and more.
